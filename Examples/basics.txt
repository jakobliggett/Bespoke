Each adventure will be composed of a storyfile, linking arching paths together and containing settings for the project.
Within the storyfile, chapterfiles are organized which represent chunks of actual text, commands, etc, and may contain minor logic themselves.
The main path of the story is handled by the storyfile, and each chapterfile returns a value by the end which dictates the next chapterfile according to storyfile logic.

STORYFILE
----------
blah blahj asdofijasdf
as
dfasdf
asdfasdf
(placeholder)


CHAPTERFILE
------------
A chapterfile prints all text enclosed within a delimiter of a newline with three dashes, '---'.
By default a chapterfile executes from top to bottom.
All text not enclosed within the dash delimiters is treated as commands. By default the script is assumed to be bespoke-script,
but by beginning the section with the magic word: "PYTHON" the script is treated as raw python code, and executed accordingly.


SETTING UP A BASIC STORY
-------------------------
This should guide you through the creation of your first bare-basics adventure.
First, initialize a blank storyfile and chapterfile through the story_designer.py program.
The storyfile will be named 'story.st' by default, and the first chapter 'chapter_1.chap'.
